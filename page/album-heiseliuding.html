            <h2 class="section-title">Song Overview</h2>
            <p>“Black Tangerine” is the title track of David Tao’s third album and one of his most experimental works. With vivid imagery and reflective lyrics, it explores loneliness and confusion in modern urban life. Blending R&B, rock, and soul, the song showcases his creative depth. The “black tangerine” image suggests a dark exterior that still holds inner hope.</p>

                <p class="lyrics-placeholder">Today my mood feels a little strange
                    But I can’t say why
                    It feels like a sign of sadness
                    Yet I don’t know the cause
                    Above me is California’s orange sun
                    In my pocket is only a black tangerine
                    I only have a blue feeling
                    Don’t ask me why
                    I want to speak, yet feel there’s nothing to say
                    I only blame myself, I can’t escape this prison
                    Maybe I’m a useless little bug
                    I shouldn’t keep dreaming, you’re not a hero
                    Leaves fall to prove the seasons change
                    But I’m drowsy and can’t wake up
                    Would you be a hero
                    Or would you give up
                    The sky is bright yet full of clouds
                    Every focus is sentenced by the flash
                    What hero do you want to be
                    I think you’re just a mercenary
                    I just want to cry, just want to cry, just want to cry
                    I just want to cry, just want to cry, just want to cry
                    When I woke up today I had a headache
                    No matter how many bottles of pills, it doesn’t help
                    My mood is restless for no reason
                    The farther you are, the better
                    Outside is California’s orange sun
                    But I hide in my lonely black hole
                    I have one small request
                    Please just leave me alone
                    I want to speak, yet feel there’s nothing to say
                    I only blame myself, I can’t escape this prison
                    Maybe I’m a useless little bug
                    I shouldn’t keep dreaming, you’re not a hero
                    Leaves fall to prove the seasons change
                    But I’m drowsy and can’t wake up
                    Would you be a hero
                    Or would you give up
                    The sky is bright yet full of clouds
                    Every focus is sentenced by the flash
                    What hero do you want to be
                    I think you’re just a mercenary
                    I just want to cry, just want to cry, just want to cry
                    I just want to cry, just want to cry, just want to cry
                    (Guitar solo + scream)
                    I just want to cry, just want to cry, just want to cry
                    I just want to cry, just want to cry, just want to cry</p>
