            <p>“Just a Friend” is one of David Tao’s signature works, featured on the album I'm OK. With a tender melody and nuanced emotion, the song explores the complexity of a relationship. Blending R&B and soul, his expressive vocal delivery turns layered feelings into a Mandopop classic.</p>

                    I wait anytime, anywhere
                    To be the one you lean on in love
                    I have no doubt
                    This is love
                    I guess
                    You wanted to make it clear long ago
                    I feel so defeated
                    Falling from heaven into the abyss
                    So helpless
                    I’m willing to change
                    What can I do
                    Start all over again
                    Just give me a chance
                    I can’t be just a friend
                    The feelings are too deep
                    How can I let go
                    But you say love
                    I only wanna be your friend
                    Just a friend
                    In your heart I am only
                    Just a friend
                    Not a lover
                    I thank you for being honest with me
                    But the love I gave you can’t be taken back yet
                    So I
                    Can’t just be
                    Your friend
                    I just can’t be your friend
                    I guess
                    You wanted to make it clear long ago
                    I feel so defeated
                    Falling from heaven into the abyss
                    So helpless
                    I’m willing to change
                    What can I do
                    Start all over again
                    Just give me a chance
                    I can’t be just a friend
                    The feelings are too deep
                    How can I let go
                    But you say love
                    I only wanna be your friend
                    Just a friend
                    In your heart I am only
                    Just a friend
                    Not a lover
                    I thank you for being honest with me
                    But the love I gave you can’t be taken back yet
                    So I
                    I can’t just be
                    Your friend
                    I just can’t be your friend
                    No, no, no
                    I can’t just be your friend
                    I can’t be just a friend</p>
