                <p class="lyrics-placeholder">Sorry, I’m not in, please leave a message after the beep
                    I’m in a lonely supermarket looking for instant noodles
                    You’ll never come back, my diary turns blank
                    Hope one day I’ll be ok
                    Hope one day I’ll be ok
                    Don’t forget your name, your number, and other things
                    Don’t speak too fast or I won’t write it down
                    Maybe you won’t call again, while I wait till my hair turns white
                    Hope one day you will call
                    Hope the phone will be ok that day
                    Chorus
                    You call in but the line is busy
                    I can’t say it, the pain is hidden inside
                    I wait patiently but it’s still busy
                    No signal, can’t get through
                    The love you give me, I can’t receive
                    I see the answering machine with a dozen messages
                    But each one is only the sound of you hanging up
                    I had no chance to answer, maybe you waited so long
                    No matter how many lines, I can’t reach you
                    No matter how many lines, I can’t reach you
                    Chorus
                    You call in but the line is busy
                    I can’t say it, the pain is hidden inside
                    I wait patiently but it’s still busy
                    No signal, can’t get through
                    The love you give me, I can’t receive
                    Bridge
                    There are so many things I still want to tell you
                    How can I get in touch with you
                    Please leave me a number so I can call
                    Only when I hear your voice I feel ok
                    Lately I’m really not ok
                    Chorus (repeat)
                    You call in but the line is busy
                    I can’t say it, the pain is hidden inside
                    I wait patiently but it’s still busy
                    No signal, can’t get through
                    The love you give me, I can’t receive
                    (Scream) I can’t receive it!
                    (Rap bridge)
                    Barefoot with two strings of bananas, standing in a storm
                    Not a single taxi is free
                    Then suddenly a miracle appears (wow, lucky)
                    A red Mercedes pulls up
                    A beautiful lady tells me to get in and I…
                    Time flies and I suddenly wake up
                    It was just a dream, am I okay? am I okay?
                    Yeah right, you think I’m a fool
                    I’m telling you I’m really not okay
                    Don’t think I’m joking
                    I’m really not okay</p>
