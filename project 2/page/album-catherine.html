            <div class="lyrics-full">
                <p class="lyrics-placeholder">You have a twisted power that makes me lose my reason
                    I’m like a machine played by you, my emotions distorted
                    Maybe you never understood, your love suffocates me
                    I think the one you love most is yourself
                    Catherine, I don’t belong to you
                    Catherine, I want to be myself
                    The tighter you hold, the harder it is to grasp what already broke
                    You don’t understand this, and you won’t reflect
                    I only hope you can understand why I walk away
                    I need to reclaim the confidence you took away
                    Catherine, I can’t live without you
                    Catherine, yet we can’t be together
                    Catherine, maybe my love just wasn’t enough, I never loved you well
                    Once we leaned on each other, now we’re apart, not just fate
                    A little pain, a little regret, and even more sighs
                    Catherine, I have to leave you
                    Catherine, even though I still love you
                    (RAP)
                    Su San left Hongtong County, a sign hung on the street
                    Surrounded by a fierce crowd, wait a moment
                    Gentlemen passing by, hear my words—who goes to Nanjing?
                    Please pass a letter to my Third Brother, tell him Su San is gone
                    In my next life I’ll be a dog or a horse to repay, come on
                    In love, pain is inevitable, one person, one world, oh~
                    I wonder if you, like me, wavered a few times—love changes easily, oh~
                    Su San says, my Su San says...</p>
